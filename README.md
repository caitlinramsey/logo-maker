## Description
This application collects information from the user after they have been asked a series of questions. The answers to these questions are complied and used to make a logo that reflects the choices made by the user. 

Inquirer is used to collect input from the user in order to generate the logo file. The text, text color, shape, and shape color that the user chooses are recorded using inquirer and used to generate the logo based on input. Jest is used to run unit tests.
